AVOID CIRCULAR BUILD DEPENDENCIES:

The core is the end-all of dependencies in this project.
All other layers of this project can be dependent on this project.

AuditCore.csproj CANNOT EVER be dependent on any other project. 
If it is, that dependency tree could break C# and .NET altogether by causing a circular build dependency.

AuditCore is the root of the dependency tree and cannot be dependent on any other part of the project.
